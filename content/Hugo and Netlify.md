This is by far my favourite way. The website you are viewing right now is made by using this method.

Once again, Your website will haveto be registered to be accessable from the public, but that will then be all. No paying GGoogle or Amazon, only the domain name. 

So let's start. 

You can do all of this using terminal, but if you want ease of use, get VS Code or Git desktop. This will make your life a little easier.

Most of the instructions layed out here is also available on the Hugo website. Please go have a look.

First, we need to install Hugo.

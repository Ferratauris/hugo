This is by far my favorite way. The website you are viewing right now is made by using this method.

Once again, Your website will haveto be registered to be accessible from the public, but that will then be all. No paying Google or Amazon, only the domain name.

So letâ€™s start.

You can do all of this using terminal, but if you want ease of use, get VS Code or Git desktop. This will make your life a little easier.

Most of the laid out here is also available on the Hugo website. Please go have a look.

First, we need to install Hugo.

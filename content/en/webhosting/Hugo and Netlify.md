This is by far my favorite way. The website you are viewing right now is made by using this method.

Once again, Your website will haveto be registered to be accessible from the public, but that will then be all. No paying Google or Amazon, only the domain name.

So letâ€™s start.

We will need a few things.

* Hugo
* git
* vscode (or a text editor like vim or emacs or notepad++ just pick one you are most comfortable with)
* A github account
* A netlify account
* Some knowledge of how all of this fits together (I will attempt to help with this)

You can do all of this using a terminal, but if you want ease of use, get VS Code or Git desktop. This will make your life a little easier.

Most of the content laid out here is also available on the Hugo website. Please go have a look.

First, we need to install Hugo.

This can be different depending on your system
Having Linux or Mac OS would make this alot easier for you

## Hugo on Linux

This is the easiest way to use Hugo.

Just open your terminal and type (Package-manager)(install) hugo vscode git

### On Debian derivatives

    sudo apt install hugo vscode git

### On Red hat derivatives

    sudo yum install hugo vscode git

### On Arch derivatives

    sudo pacman -S hugo vscode git

### On Suse derivatives

    sudo zypper install hugo vscode git

It really couldn't be easier. You just tell your computer what to do and it does it.

## Hugo on Mac OS

For you apple fans out there! Open a terminal by pressing (Cmd+Shift+P) and run one of these commands

    brew install hugo visual-studio-code git

or

    port install hugo visual-studio-code git

Vscode can also be downloaded from their website for Mac. Follow the link below for more information



## Hugo on Windows

Windows has a powerful powershell. Let's put it to good use.
But WAIT! we can't just start using it. First it needs to be set up.
Windows uses Chocolatey or winget to install from powershell
Winget is the official package manager and choco is a community powered package manager
First Chocolatey needs to be set up

### Install Chocolatey

We need to ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not restricted

* open powershell as administrator
* Run Get-ExecutionPolicy

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

If it returns:

```
Restricted
```

Run

    Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned 

Then run the following command:


    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Once this is done, We can start with the fun stuffs: using a nix like package manager in Windows

Run

```
choco install hugo git vscode
```
Now the software needed should be installed. Wasn't that quick and painless?

## Netlify

Ok. Now you do need a Netlify account. So follow the link below

https://www.netlify.com

You need to sign in or create a Netlify account.
If you don't have a Netlify account, click on signup, enter your email and choose a password atleast 10 characters long
Then go to your inbox, click on Verify.
Now you will be asked to introduce yourself to Netlify.
You do you on this page. Fill it as you see fit.

The next page will ask you to deploy your first project. We will get to this soon. But first...

## Github

You need to set up a Github account. So follow the link below

https://github.com

Sign in. Or if you do not have an existing account, Sign up:
Enter your email and click on Sign up for Github. Enter a password and click continue
Then enter a username and click continue
then type y if you want to receive product updates via email. Otherwise type n and click continue
Then do an account verification
When that is done, click on create account
Then go to your email and find the otp sent to you and enter it.
Fill the welcome page as you see fit.
Next, pick free. 

Finally, we can start building a website

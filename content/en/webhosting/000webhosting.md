### first time setup

The first and easiest way to make a website is also free. All you have to do, is navigate to https://www.000webhost.com/ 
Once you are there: Create an account or login if you already have one.

Verify your email. Go to your registered email and just click verify

You will be taken to a first things first page. Here you can choose between:

* Learn web development
* Build an online store
* Create web design
* Start blog
* Other

We want to make a blog. but just to have more control, we will choose Other.
You will be prompted to download Google Chrome. I am more parial to Vivaldi.
This is all up to you

On the next page, choose a website name.
I will be choosing mylinuxblog
I found the proccess to be alot easier if you let 000webhost generate a password

## DO NOT EVER LOOSE YOUR PASSWORD! NEVER LOSE ANY LOGIN DETAILS!
## BACKUPS ARE IMPORTANT!

## Installing Wordpress

You will be faced with an option menu where you may pick:

* Use Our Wesite Builder
* Install Wordpress
* upload Your Site

Now, from here, once again. To each his own. But to make things easier
and to have more control, we are going to pick Install Wordpress

Once again you will be prompted to create a username and password.
I found it easier to just leave it all default.

Now Wordpress should be installing. this shouldn't take too long
After it is done, You can click on "Go to configuration page"
This will take ypu to the login page for your wordpress.
The wordpress username and password should be used here

I don't know if it's a glitch or something, 
but when I try to change the username and password,
I can never seem to be able to get into the admin page of Wordpress.
It just never recognises my username or password.
So just leave it default to avoid headache

After batteling with the interface to give you access for enough time, You will finally be greated with an awesome website managing page with many features.

I would advise playing around here. Go explore. See what you can do. If you want to follow a strict guide, you may stick around and see how I prefer to dp things.

## Choosing Plugins

Firstly, click on plugins then installed plugins.

I like to taylor my experience. So I will remove all of them in stalled plugins.

First they must all be deactivated. The quickesst way of doing this, is to click the select all checkbox at the top.

Click on the Bulk actions dropdown menu and pick Deactivate.
Hit the Apply button. We do the same to delete all plugins.
Click on the Bulk actions dropdown menu and pick Delete.
Hit the Apply button.

## Now we install our own plugins.

On the left side, click Add New
On the right side, we can search for plugins.

The first one will be Classic editor. I don't know why, but every time I try to write a new post, It never gets saved.
I have found Classic Editor helps with that.
So just click install now. It will install Classic Editor.
This can be activated after installation is done, by clicking on Activate.

Here is a list and explanation of plugins That I would install

* bb Press: It allows for a forum like setup. This is great for having people interact with each other on the website and great for research on what you should do next.

* All-in-One WP Migration: This is awesome for backing up your website or uploading to a new webhost if you want to leave your current webhost.

* WP Mail SMTP by WPForms: This allows you to have a contact form. If this was a website to show off to potential employers, and you really don't want to share your personal email, This is a great plugin to have. Or for any communication from visitors to you.

* Site Kit by Google – Analytics, Search Console, AdSense, Speed: This is a good one. It is a tool to Annalise how your website is doing, have a search function and have Google Ads on your website. If enough people see your ads, You can get paid for it.

* Elementor Website Builder: This is going to make the website pretty

* Starter Templates — Elementor, Gutenberg & Beaver Builder Templates: This is also for making the pretty happen.

From here, we can go back to Installed plugins. Under each plugin are the options

* Deactivate
* Settings
* About

Go to settings to change how plugins will behave.

This is all I will tell you about plugins. Go wild and make it your own. 

## Beautification

Next I want to make my site look pretty
So I will go to Appearance on the left and click on themes.
Here, you will see a lot of different themes. I however, would and terrible at making things look pretty (I am one ugly ferret). So scroll to the bottom and pick. Add New.

The theme that I will search for, is Astra. Click install and then activate.

Now under Appearance, a new menu had appeared called Starter Templates. This will be our next destination.
Click on it. A Select page builder prompt will appear.
I will pick Elementor. After that, Templates will appear. Pick anyone you want. Then at the bottom, choose Import complete site.

Elementor will ask you a few questions. Answer them. You will also have the option to skip them at the bottom.

From here we can go to Pages then all pages on the left-hand side.

Hover over any of the pages and options will pop up to
* Edit
* Quick Edit
* Bin
* View
* Edit with Elementor

Choose edit with Elementor and start customizing things to your liking.

That is all you need to know! 

## Now go and make your first free website.

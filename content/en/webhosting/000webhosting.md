The first and easiest way to make a website is also free. All you haveto do, is navigate to https://www.000webhost.com/ 
Once you are there: Create an account or login if you already have one.

Verify your email. Go to your registered email and just click verify

You will be taken to a first things first page. Here you can choose between:

* Learn web development
* Build an online store
* Create web design
* Start blog
* Other

We want to make a blog. but just to have more control, we will choose Other.
You will be prompted to download Google Chrome. I am more parial to Vivaldi.
This is all up to you

On the next page, choose a website name.
I will be choosing mylinuxblog
I found the proccess to be alot easier if you let 000webhost generate a password

DO NOT EVER LOOSE YOUR PASSWORD! NEVER LOSE ANY LOGIN DETAILS!
BACKUPS ARE IMPORTANT!

You will be faced with an option menu where you may pick:

* Use Our Wesite Builder
* Install Wordpress
* upload Your Site

Now, from here, once again. To each his own. But to make things easier
and to have more control, we are going to pick Install Wordpress

Once again you will be prompted to create a username and password.
I found it easier to just leave it all default.

Now Wordpress should be installing. this shouldn't take too long
After it is done, You can click on "Go to configuration page"
This will take ypu to the login page for your wordpress.
The wordpress username and password should be used here

I don't know if it's a glitch or something, 
but when I try too change the username and password,
I can never seem to be able to get into the admin page of Wordpress.
It just never recognises my username or password.
So just leave it default to avoid headache

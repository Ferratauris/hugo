Well. This is  a little awkward.
I have been quiet for a few seconds of time.

This is not entirely on purpose.
Yes I have been resting on medical advice to not be so busy all the time and give my body a time to rest.
In coming back to continue my mission, I have found that all my learning material has been lost.
This plays so well intomy rant where I really hammer home how important backups are.

I should have made backups of my backups and practiced what I preach but alas I have not done so.

This is not a total loss.

I have a backup plan.  It does not have the same structure  but I will try my best to stay consistent.

Please forgive me if I  am not.

Let's get this party started!

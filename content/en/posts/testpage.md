This is just a quick rant about my love for Linux and specifically Arch Linux.
Linux is nothing short of amazing.
Every distro can be customized down to the kernel.
You have the option of installing ready made custom kernels like xanmod, liquorix or tkg.
Or you can just go ahead and customize your own kernel.

Arch is built differently. The awesome people behind arch said: "What if we could build our own version of Linux, but easier?"
There are versions of Arch that include a handful of packages and you can install a fully functional version of the distro with all the bells and whistles you want.
Or you could get a base version of the distro with nothing installed. And instead of compiling everything, you could just go ahead and install packages that will later become a fully functional distro of your own design.

My second favorite part is the AUR. (Arch user repository)
If there is a piece of software that is not supported by the official devs of Arch Linux, you can always just use a simple command just like the normal package manager and have it built and installed.
Nothing can get any simpler.

I have considered moving away from Arch. But I can never leave an ecosystem that has so many options available.

"Ok, but what about malicious intent?
What if there is an AUR package that has a backdoor that will be installed?"

One can really ask the same of any FOSS (Free and open source) project.

The secret is in the name. The source code can be viewed by anyone.

"But. That doesn't matter to me, I can't read the code anyway!"

That is fine. You don't need to. You need to remember that if you need to use a certain piece of software, so do a lot of other people.
And many of them are able to read the code.

The Linux community is very vocal when they do not like something.
Anyone who uploads any kind of malicious code will be removed before you can blink.

So many options are available! The only limit is you!

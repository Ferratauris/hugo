## The CLI

To some of the newcomers, the CLI might be scary or feel outdated.
I actually heard a client of mine call the black screen before a BIOS boot,where  there is a prompt to press F1 to continue,  A "Hacker's paradise screen"

To me, this was a huge wake up call. While I understand the fundamentals of computing down to the component level, There are people whose experience never goes beyond tuning on a monitor and clicking on items.

From a non computer oriented perspective,we first need to understand that a computer is nothing but electrical signals being blocked or unblocked.  (Verily simply put. Not to undermine the brilliant minds that make computing possible.)

Next, we need to understand that for all our amazing abilities as humans, we do not have the ability to divert electrical signals on our own. We have the computer hardware to do so.

before a computer can even start computing, The central part, which is the motherboard, must first do a few checks to make sure that:

1. All the components have the ability to communicate with each other
2. The computer has a way of communicating with you.
3. There is an interpereter in place to make communication between you and a few dozen electrical signals possible.

So the motherboard checked, all the components were there to communicate with each other and none of them had reported any faults.

Great! now the motherboard checks for display, the way it will be communicating with you. Then it checks for a keyboard, the way you will communicate with it.

Knowing all these parts are present and functioning, The motherboard allows the interpereter to start speaking. Now your computer is showing it's brand logo or a windows icon with the dots circling at the bottom.

This is the interpereter getting all of it's tools ready for you.

Next, you get to a login screen. And now, it's finally your turn to grab the mouse and start doing things.

While I have just mentioned Windows, Few people out there even know that there are other interpereters out there.

We call them Operating Systems. To name a few of the most popular ones,  we have Windows, Apple OS and Linux  distros.

For the most part, Most people will grow up knowing  and loving a Windows computer.
Some will discover the Apple lifestyle.
And others will become uber nerds and start using Linux.

All of these have their own areas they excel at.
For Windows, Windows is the workhorse everyone knows and trusts. It plays your games and it edits your documents. Absolutely perfect for the working and studying class.
For Apple, Apple is unparalleled in creating content. Designs, Music, Videos. Apple isamust have in this field.
For Linux. Linux is a server OS. This means that most of the world is run off of Linux in the background.
This very website is being shown to you using a Linux computing device.

Ok so now we have all this knowledge. What  now?

Well first we'll need to understand  that to use Linux and  use it the best way, we will need to use the CLI (Command Line Interface)

Why doesn't Linux just use Gui?

Well it does to some extent in desktop distros. However, A server will usually be accessed remotely  and for the most part, can not display graphics. So we use CLI to communicate with it.

Furthermore. When using a GUI, one can only do an action if a button has been designed for it. In CLI we don't need buttons. We can simply tell the computer what  we want to do and have it done.

This is why we love CLI. Wecan doso much more with such little effort.

I say such little effort. But  truthfully,Firstwe will need to learn how to do it. So maybe a little more effort  than was advertised.

## Launching nano

Don't let the subtitle scare you off. Nano is noob friendly, yes, but that doesn't mean only noobs use it.
I myself prefer nano as other text editors have a pretty steep learning curve. Nano is much easier.

To launch nano, simply type "nano" in your terminal

```
nano
```

You can also specify an existing filename to open that file in nano. Or you can specify a new filename to create a file and open it in nano.

```
nano newfile.txt
```

We can use arrow keys to move around in a text file opened in nano.
Nano also has shortcut keys shown at the bottom to help us to do common tasks.

The "^" stands for ctrl and then the letter or character after.
To save, for example, is "ctrl+O" (Write out)
To access the "help" page, press "ctrl+h"

Here, more will be explained, like "m" standing for "Alt" 

There are some basics that I could mention

* "Ctrl+x" Close without saving (nano will give you the option to save if you do this anyways)
* "Ctrl+o" Write or save file
* "Ctrl+r" open or insert another file (There will be more options listed if you press this shortcut)
* "Alt+a" mark a region to be cut or copied
* "Alt+Shift+6" Copy text
* "<" and ">" to move between opened files in nano

## Conclusion

You should now be able to open and create files using nano.
And do some advanced tasks aswell
You should also be able to open more than one file.

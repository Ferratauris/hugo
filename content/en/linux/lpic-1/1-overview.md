Linux can be overwhelming to anyone who is new to the community
Where do you go?
What do you do?
How does any of this work?

In this series of articles, I will attempt to explain on a level that is comfortable to the newcomer and empowers the pro.

I want to create an environment where anyone can learn the fundamentals of LPIC-1
This will explain my level of knowledge and expand yours.

### This is not meant to be all the information needed to pass the LPIC-1 exam. This is meant to compliment your current studies and perhaps fill the gaps and answer questions if you have any. Please study for the exam properly if you are planning on taking it.

### What do we get out of this?

Well for me, it is all about spreading the knowledge of linux. I get to show of my skill and teach others what I know

For you, this will help infinitely in your professional field 
If you are a system admin or a server support or learning cloud computing or even just an enthusiast who would like to broaden their horizons. Chances are you have at least heard of Linux and if you are like me, you are very interested.

Many systems are built on linux. If you are using a browser. It's hosted on Linux. Your Android phone is running a version of linux. Cloud services are Linux based. Linux makes the world go round and I am excited to share this absolute powerhouse of computing.

You will need to know a few things like:

* How do you install software
* How to manage services
* How to troubleshoot
* How to configure storage

We will be doing this and more.


Below is a list of core parts of what this article series will hold

* Installing Linux
* Executing programs
* Working with text files
* Locating Data
* File permissions
* Managing software
* Managing services
* Managing Storage
* The Linux Command Line

I will attempt to post at least one article a day, explaining in depth all of the above mentioned parts.

### Let's get started.

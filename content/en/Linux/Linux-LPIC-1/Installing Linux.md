In this article we are going to talk about the fundamentals of installing Linux.

* How and where to get a Linux distribution (Distro)
* How to build an installation media
* How to install Linux onto a system

First We will need to ensure that we have a system that can actually run linux.
Research will need to be done.
Next we will need to decide which Distro to use.
There are a whole slew of available distros.
Most of which are based on root distros and then built from there
The root distros include but are not limited to:

* Slackware (one of the oldest distros). Distros based on slackware include:
 S.U.S.E

 * Debian (One of the most supported distros). Distros based on linux include:
 Sparky Linux
 Linux Mint Debian Edition
 sparky Linux
 SteamOs (The old one)
 Lindows
 Backtrack
 kali
 Raspberry Pi OS
 Tails
 Ubuntu

 Ubuntu also has a whole slew of distros based on it which include:
 Kununtu
 Deepin
 Backtrack
 Zorin OS

 * Red Hat (An enterprise version of Linux) Distros based on Red Hat include:
 ClearOS
 Oracle Linux
 CentOS
 Qubes OS
 Mandrake
 Open Mandriva

As you can clearly see, Linux runs your world. It would be to your benefit to understand is

For LPIC-1 We will focus on Ubuntu and CentOS

### The first thing I need you to understand is that Linux is Linux. Everything that works for one will most likely work for all of them.

A distro is just Linux with a few handy programs installed. You are free to mix and match
You don't need to have Kali Linux to be able to do penetration testing. You only need to install the programs on the distro of your choice. Everything in Linux is cusomisable

Please also take note that the biggest difference between distro families are the way software is installed. Apt does not work on Arch and Zypper will not work in Ubuntu.
This is the only major difference between distro families

To get ubuntu we need to go to the Ubuntu website. The link is below

https://ubuntu.com

click on Download. 

On the download page, we can pick between different versions of Ubuntu. They are all essentially the same thing, but they have different packages pre-installed to make your life easier.

We are going to pick Ubuntu desktop

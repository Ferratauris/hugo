Yes! Hello world.
Hello and welcome!
This is my new website, glad you could make it.

What is this all about?
Well. This will be a platform of free education. 

Want your own website? Let's build one or 2 or even 5 together.
Need an IT qualification?
I can help. I won't give you one, but I can show you anything you need to know.

Want to game on Linux?
I have been. For a long time.

In short. I am an IT fanatic. I might not have any qualifications but I have years of hands on experience. 

On this website I will flex my skill, and I will give you the muscle to flex too.

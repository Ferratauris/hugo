You will also haveto register a domain name if you want the website to be publically accessable. The good thing is, These services can also be used for other purposes like hosting your own VPN or even a game server. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>So here is what you do:
First, you create a Google, Azure or Amazon account. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, The are all the same. The same method will also be used when setting up a website on a local computer or VM.
Next, You navige to the cloud section. All three are very simular in alot of ways. That is why I will be bundling them together. The only real difference is how the actual Virtual Machine server is set up. Once the Operating system  is installed, All of them will function in the same way. You will also almost never touch the backend again. Wordpress will be installed. And from there, everything will be the same as 000webhost.</p>
<p>I will still explain Wordpress here I can&rsquo;t expect you to go read 2 articles to do one thing.</p>
